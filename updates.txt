Update 1: Patched for 3.3.x compatibility.

Update 2: A couple small bugs have been patched and some extra things have been added.

- Knife and Crowbar can now directly activate their respective puzzles (GZDoom 3.3.2 addition).
- Range of melee weapons has been reduced slightly.
- Fixed AI routine of critters with AMBUSH (previously they wouldn't check sight until they heard a noise).
- Copied Strife inventory behavior so items can be used with a single press.
- Restored intended Crowbar crit behavior (squared damage).
- Doubled health of Bruiser Critter so it's more of a threat.
- Implemented easy mode, reduces enemy damage and health and adds more items.
- Implemented hard mode, increased enemy damage and health and removes a couple items here and there.
- Made shaders configurable.
- Flashlight now uses a spotlight.

Update 3: Fixed crash after picking up Pearl Key due to door transition activator being null.

Update 4: Various small fixes.

Update 5: Fixes and rebalancing.

- Texture misalignment corrections (Thanks, Rachael).
- Hard mode has been rebalanced.
- Fixed some breakage in the monster AI (e.g.: constantly re-entering chase state when player is dead or constantly attacking a dead player)

Update 6: Minor bug fixes and more tweaks.

- Monster attack behavior and health have been rebalanced.
- Cheats are enabled in Easy and Medium now.

Update 7: Map stuff fixed and even more rebalancing.

- Added missing blocking flags to some lines.
- Corrected a 3D floor tag (those chairs look normal now).
- Fixed a certain floor lowering 64 units instead of the intended 8.

Update 8: Sequence breaking?

- Added a way to inhibit door activation while in cutscenes to prevent race conditions.

Update 9: The cleanup

- Cleaned up various ZScript warnings. Fine-tuned some math in the process.
- Made Old Key spawn on the spot where the Vile Critter died. Should be easier to notice.
- Bleeding texture shader has been rewritten. No longer needs tone mapping to be enabled and there are no more texture seams (requires a recent gzdoom devbuild)
- Fixed Vile Critter projectiles not exploding on boss death.
