Update 1: Patched for 3.3.x compatibility.

Update 2: A couple small bugs have been patched and some extra things have been added.

- Knife and Crowbar can now directly activate their respective puzzles (GZDoom 3.3.2 addition).
- Range of melee weapons has been reduced slightly.
- Fixed AI routine of critters with AMBUSH (previously they wouldn't check sight until they heard a noise).
- Copied Strife inventory behavior so items can be used with a single press.
- Restored intended Crowbar crit behavior (squared damage).
- Doubled health of Bruiser Critter so it's more of a threat.
- Implemented easy mode, reduces enemy damage and health and adds more items.
- Implemented hard mode, increased enemy damage and health and removes a couple items here and there.
- Made shaders configurable.
- Flashlight now uses a spotlight.

Update 3: Fixed crash after picking up Pearl Key due to door transition activator being null.

Update 4: Various small fixes.

Update 5: Fixes and rebalancing.

- Texture misalignment corrections (Thanks, Rachael).
- Hard mode has been rebalanced.
- Fixed some breakage in the monster AI (e.g.: constantly re-entering chase state when player is dead or constantly attacking a dead player)

Update 6: Minor bug fixes and more tweaks.

- Monster attack behavior and health have been rebalanced.
- Cheats are enabled in Easy and Medium now.

Update 7: Map stuff fixed and even more rebalancing.

- Added missing blocking flags to some lines.
- Corrected a 3D floor tag (those chairs look normal now).
- Fixed a certain floor lowering 64 units instead of the intended 8.

Update 8: Sequence breaking?

- Added a way to inhibit door activation while in cutscenes to prevent race conditions.

Update 9: The cleanup

- Cleaned up various ZScript warnings. Fine-tuned some math in the process.
- Made Old Key spawn on the spot where the Vile Critter died. Should be easier to notice.
- Bleeding texture shader has been rewritten. No longer needs tone mapping to be enabled and there are no more texture seams (requires a recent gzdoom devbuild)
- Fixed Vile Critter projectiles not exploding on boss death.

Update 10: The anniversary update

- Fixed everything that could potentially break on 3.7 and up.
- Small adjustments to the map. Now "under the stairs" makes more sense.
- Tuned up a lot of text.
- Tweaked enemies.
  * Roaming critters now mind their own business unless you startle them, which is what I originally intended.
  * Chomper critters aren't as annoying to get bitten by now.
  * Brawler critters have a proper charge with a tackle on hit (this is also something I initally wanted but didn't know how to make).
  * Vile critter shouldn't destroy the framerate anymore and is probably less annoying.
- Fine-tuned the way save squares work. It's crimesâ„¢ but works.
- Added a new difficulty setting, for those who seek a real challenge.
- Added player sprites and sounds.
- Added a neat visual effect during fake loading screens.
- Added a little easter egg room that couldn't be done in time for the contest.
- Added a special secret involving certain paintings.
- Invited a surprise guest.

Update 10.1: Hotfix

- Fix end level stats staying in the titlemap.

Update 10.2: Hotfix 2 - Hotfix Harder

- Backtracking to room 624 from otherworld 2nd floor started the wrong ambient, which would get stuck permanently.
