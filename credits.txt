Scuba Steve - Knife sprites.
??? - Pistol right handed / reloading sprites.
Xatrix Entertainment (Redneck Rampage) - Base crowbar sprites.
Team Silent, Akira Yamaoka - Various assorted Silent Hill sounds.
id Software - Original critter sprites.
Epic Games - Gib and bullet sounds.
ZZYZX - Slope alignment code.
Jimmy - Status Report fonts.
lol - .flow sounds.
Haversine - SCP-087 fangame assets.

Textures were scavenged from random UT99 texture packs, so I have no idea who
made all of them. Hit me up if you know.

I also haven't been able to track down who exactly made the pistol sprites.
The mod I got them from only listed all authors in a big cluster, without
specifying who made what.
