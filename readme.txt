A Silent Hill inspired Doom map for GZDoom 3.7.0. Originally created in the
span of almost a month for Joel's Doom Mapping Contest II.

You wake up in an old apartment building. The way out is locked, and you must
find the key.

Yes, I can do other things besides replacing everything with Tim Allen.

I spent way too much time on tiny details, so the map itself is kind of rushed.
Light shadowmaps, bloom and SSAO are recommended for the best experience.

I seriously hope everything's well balanced and there are no bugs or
performance issues, I can't exactly afford playtesters.

This is pretty much a demo of sorts, I guess. I could have done something much
bigger and fleshed out if I had more time.

The map is blatantly inspired by the Silent Hill series.

Credits for assets and stuff are inside the pk7. Everything should be fine in
terms of copyright. From experience, Konami seems to go only after the FMVs
from SH games, the ambience is safe.

Important things to know:

0. You have to pick up items by pressing use on them. Make sure all the
   inventory management keys are bound (next/prev item, activate, drop, etc.).
1. Weapons can only be selected from the inventory, like any other item, for
   consistency reasons. Selecting the same weapon again will holster it. When
   not wielding a weapon you generally move faster.
2. The fire button can be held to charge melee weapons.
3. To read notes, press use on them, too. Press use again or walk away to close
   the message.
4. Please use the very obvious Silent Hill 2 red squares for saving, instead of
   quicksaves.
5. There are no jumpscares (intentional ones, at least. You can easily
   "jumpscare" yourself by walking face first into an enemy when turning a
   corner, for example).
6. Cheats are disabled. The map may break horribly if you use them, especially
   noclip.
7. The graphics look like crap on purpose.
8. Enemies will only chase after you if you get close or make noise. They won't
   aggro from a kilometer away like in ol' standard doom.
9. Cirno is the strongest fairy.
