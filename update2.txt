A couple small bugs have been patched and some extra things have been added.

- Knife and Crowbar can now directly activate their respective puzzles (GZDoom 3.3.2 addition).
- Range of melee weapons has been reduced slightly.
- Fixed AI routine of critters with AMBUSH (previously they wouldn't check sight until they heard a noise).
- Copied Strife inventory behavior so items can be used with a single press.
- Restored intended Crowbar crit behavior (squared damage).
- Doubled health of Bruiser Critter so it's more of a threat.
- Implemented easy mode, reduces enemy damage and health and adds more items.
- Implemented hard mode, increased enemy damage and health and removes a couple items here and there.
- Made shaders configurable.
- Flashlight now uses a spotlight.
